Background and problem description 
Chemical engineers measured various properties of a gas and created a training data set with four features temperature (T), pressure (P), thermal conductivity (TC), and sound velocity (SV). They also  calculated  the  gas  quality  using  four  measured  properties  and  converted  it  into  a  quality index  (Idx).  They  want  to  know  if  any  functional  relationships  exist  between  the  measured properties and the gas quality. The schema of the data set is:  
Dataset(T, P, TC, SV, Idx) where the type of each attribute is double. 
Develop the best predictive model for the training data set using Python and write an analysis report.
